## About

This repository documents my journey to learn and master the MERN stack, a powerful combination of technologies for web development. I will be sharing code snippets, projects, and progress updates as I work through a structured curriculum.

## Curriculum

### Week 1-2: JavaScript Fundamentals
- **Day 1-3:** Basic JavaScript (variables, data types, operators, functions)
- **Day 4-6:** Intermediate JavaScript (arrays, objects, loops, DOM manipulation)
- **Day 7-14:** Advanced JavaScript (closures, promises, async/await)

### Week 3-4: Node.js
- **Day 1-4:** Introduction to Node.js (setup, modules, file system)
- **Day 5-7:** Building RESTful APIs with Express.js
- **Day 8-14:** Asynchronous Programming in Node.js (callbacks, promises, async/await)

### Week 5-6: MongoDB
- **Day 1-3:** Introduction to MongoDB (CRUD operations, data modeling)
- **Day 4-7:** Mongoose ODM (schema, models, querying)
- **Day 8-14:** Building a simple Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB application

### Week 7-8: React
- **Day 1-3:** Introduction to React (components, JSX, state, props)
- **Day 4-7:** React Router (routing)
- **Day 8-14:** State Management with Redux or Context API

### Week 9-10: Full-Stack Integration
- **Day 1-3:** Building a MERN CRUD application
- **Day 4-7:** Authentication and Authorization (JWT, Passport.js)
- **Day 8-14:** Connecting the frontend (React) to the backend (Node.js + Express.js)

### Week 11-12: Advanced Topics
- **Day 1-7:** Testing (Jest, Mocha, Chai for backend and React Testing Library for frontend)
- **Day 8-14:** Deployment (Heroku, AWS, or another cloud platform)
