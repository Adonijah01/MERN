## About

This repository documents my journey to learn and master the MERN stack, a powerful combination of technologies for web development. I will be sharing code snippets, projects, and progress updates as I work through a structured curriculum.

## Curriculum

### Week 1-2: JavaScript Fundamentals
- **Day 1-3:** Basic JavaScript (variables, data types, operators, functions)
- **Day 4-6:** Intermediate JavaScript (arrays, objects, loops, DOM manipulation)
- **Day 7-14:** Advanced JavaScript (closures, promises, async/await)

(Continue with detailed curriculum for each week)

## Daily GitHub Projects

I commit to pushing code to this repository on a daily basis as part of my learning journey. Each day, I will work on coding exercises, projects, or improvements related to the MERN stack. Here's the breakdown of my daily GitHub activities:
